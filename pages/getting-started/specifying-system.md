# Specifying System

Like we said in the previous section: You can define a system to anything in Atros; to tasks, packages, and parameters. Let's see examples for each of them in this section.

## üìù Tasks With a System

You can define a system for a whole task to run it only in the specified system.

```typescript
[
  {
    type: "shell",
    cmd: "echo 'I use Arch btw'",
    system: "arch",
  },
];
```

Simple, isn't it? Let's look at another example of installing packages.

```typescript
[
  {
    type: "install",
    packages: ["neovim", "firefox"], // Cross-platform packages
  },
  {
    type: "install",
    packages: ["build-essentials"], // A debian package
    system: "debian",
  },
];
```

This looks great, right? No, it does not. Trust me.

## üì¶ Packages With a System

Writing a whole new task to install a package in a different system is verbose and not up to ~Pollos~ Atros standards. Instead, you can define a system for packages too! Let's see the same example without the verbosity.

```typescript
[
  {
    type: "install",
    packages: [
      "neovim",
      "firefox",
      {
        system: "debian",
        list: ["build-essential"],
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

This is much simpler, especially when you're automating your real environment. But what about installing packages that require different parameters in different systems? Like, installing the Neovide package requires a `--cask` parameter. Again, defining a new task to install a package for each different system is not up to our standards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters With a System

Let's see how we would define a system for a parameter. We'll use a verbose way here, and they will fix it to use a single task.

```typescript
[
  {
    type: "install",
    packages: ["neovim", "firefox"],
  },
  {
    type: "install",
    packages: ["neovide"],
    parameters: [
      {
        system: "mac",
        list: ["--cask"], // Use --cask parameter in MacOS
      },
    ],
    // This is the exact same way the pre-defined cask parameter is implemented
    // So, you could just use this to get the same result:
    // parameters: [cask]
  },
];
```

As the comment lines state, this is an already defined parameter. However, we'll continue using it to demonstrate. After you learn, you can use any parameter you want with a system.

Here we accomplish what we want: A system-specific task. But it took a whole new task to do it, where we could simply define a parameter inside the `packages` field of one single task. Let's see.

```typescript
[
  {
    type: "install",
    packages: [
      "neovim",
      "firefox",
      {
        list: ["neovide"],
        params: [
          {
            list: ["--cask"],
            system: "mac",
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

Just like that!
