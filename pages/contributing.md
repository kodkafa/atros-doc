# Contributing

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to the Atros project. It's nice to see you among us.

The best way to find what to contribute in the project is to use it personally for your different needs. To do that, install Atros in your system. You can find the [Getting Started guide in the README file](/README.md#getting-started), follow these steps to start contributing.

## About the Repositories

The main repository is the one you're inside currently, and it's a single binary Rust application that follows Rust's module structure. Therefore, it's simple to work on.

There are two more repositories to know about: [config-template](https://github.com/kodkafa/config-template), which is the main configuration template that you clone to your .config/ directory when you run `atros init`, and in this template repository, we have [config-prerequisites](https://github.com/kodkafa/config-prerequisites) as a git submodule. The reason for having a separate repo is to be able to update Atros easily without wiping users' defined steps. Since the type definitions in that repository might get updated at some point, when we implement an `upgrade` CLI command in this tool, we want to upgrade not only the binary itself but also the prerequisites folder (which is .atros in the ~/.config/atros/ folder)

## How to Contribute to the Main Repository

### Fork This Repo

You can fork this repo by clicking the fork button in the top right corner of this page.

```sh
# Clone on your local machine
git --recursive clone git@github.com:your-username/atros.git # --recursive is for examples/ folder

# Navigate to the project directory
cd atros/

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b cool-branch
```

Then, you're ready to hack!

```sh
cargo run               # Will print help text
cargo run -- <command>  # Will run the command you provide: init, run, help, etc.
```

## How to Contribute to Prerequisites

If you want to change type definitions or add new ones, this will be helpful.

### Fork the Repo

Go to [config-prerequisites](https://github.com/kodkafa/config-prerequisites) repository, and fork it.

### Replace the default prerequisites with yours

```sh
# Go to your config
cd ~/.config/atros

# Remove the default prerequisites folder
rm -rf .atros

# Clone your forked repo
git clone git@github.com:your-username/config-prerequisites.git .atros

# Navigate to the repo
cd .atros

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b cool-types
```

And again, you're ready to hack!
